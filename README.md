## Overview

The goal was to build a simple blog that saves composed posts into a mongodb database, displays a short summary on the home route and 
links each post to a dynamic "post" route. Additional information is served on the About Us and Contact Us pages. I have made minor adjustments 
to the content, layout and styling to add a personal touch to the design. 

## Process
To dynamically serve content into pages I used EJS with partials for the header and footer alongside plain Javascript. The app is setup using node.js with express.js. Posts get saved into 
a mongoDB database. The live version uses mongoDB Atlas. Live version got deployed to Heroku, you can check it out [here](https://warm-earth-32518.herokuapp.com/).

### Built with: 
- node.js
- ejs
- express
- mongoose
- mongoDB
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML
